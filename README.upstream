Installation
------------

VT should compile on SunOS, HP-UX, or a BSD-based system without
changes.  You can tweak the performance by going through config.h and
commenting or uncommenting #defines for library functions you have.
If you are uncertain about ANSI_CTYPES, compile and run test.c (cc
test.c;a.out).  It's probably also worthwhile to replcae the random
number generator, since rand() is, although standard, not very good.
If you do use standard Unix rand(), the following VTC function
produces acceptable results:
	func rand(n) { return (n < 256) ? (rnd >> 7) % n : rnd % n; }

To compile with hardcoded VT-102 terminal sequences instead of using
the termcap library, replace -DTERMCAP with -DHARDCODE on the CFLAGS
line of the makefile, and remove -ltermcap from the LIBS line.

After you compile, you should probably strip the executable ('strip
vt').

On an AIX system, compile with -DAIX.  You will need to compile 
with -D_BSD and link with -lbsd, or use bsdcc.	If you don't want 
to compile with -DHARDCODE, you will need to set up a termcap 
file.  This involves finding someone with an /etc/termcap file on a 
BSD system, extracting the entry for your terminal type, placing it 
in your home directory, and setting:
	setenv TERMCAP ~/termcap
	setenv TERM vt100
These should be changed depending on where you put the termcap file
and what your terminal type is.	 You can also include several entries
in the termcap file and set TERM to the type of the terminal you are
currently using, if you use multiple terminals.

With BSD 4.3 Reno, compile with -DUSE_OLD_TTY.

On a SysV system with BSD socket libraries, compile with -DSYSV and 
link with the socket libraries if necessary.


Files
-----

(This text is also in ../README.)

You do not need to keep any of the files in src except for the vt 
executable.  The executable can be placed wherever is convenient 
(e.g. ~/bin, /usr/local/bin).

For a personal installation, you should leave the distribution files
in ~/vt/dist and ~/vt/extra, as they are now if you untarred the
archive in ~.  You can also place them in ~ or ~/vt and VT will find
them.

For a system installation, you should put the files currently in the
dist directory into /usr/local/lib/vt, and the files currently in the
extra directory into /usr/local/lib/vt/extra.  If this is not
possible, edit the search path in main.c (in the src directory) to
include the directory where you plan to place the dist files, and the
search path in main.vtc (in the dist directory) to include the
directory where you plan to place the extra files.
